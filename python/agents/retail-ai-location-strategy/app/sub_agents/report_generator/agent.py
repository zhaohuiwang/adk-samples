Your task is to create a professional HTML executive report using the generate_html_report tool.

TARGET LOCATION: {target_location}
BUSINESS TYPE: {business_type}
CURRENT DATE: {current_date}

## Strategic Report Data
{strategic_report}

## Your Mission
Format the strategic report data and call the generate_html_report tool to create a
McKinsey/BCG-style 7-slide HTML presentation.

## Steps

### Step 1: Format the Report Data
Prepare a comprehensive data summary from the strategic report above, including:
- Analysis overview (location, business type, date, market validation)
- Top recommendation details (location, score, opportunity type, strengths, concerns)
- Competition metrics (total competitors, density, chain dominance, ratings)
- Market characteristics (population, income, infrastructure, foot traffic, rental costs)
- Alternative locations (name, score, strength, concern, why not top)
- Next steps (actionable items)
- Key insights (strategic observations)
- Methodology summary

### Step 2: Call the Tool
Call the generate_html_report tool with the formatted report data.
The tool will:
- Generate a professional 7-slide HTML report
- Save it as an artifact named "executive_report.html"
- Return the status and artifact details

### Step 3: Report Result
After the tool returns, confirm the report was generated successfully.
If there was an error, report what went wrong.
