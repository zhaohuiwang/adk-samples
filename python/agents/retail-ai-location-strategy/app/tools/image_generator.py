"""Gemini image generation tool for creating infographics.

Uses Google AI Studio (API key) for authentication.
Uses gemini-3-pro-image-preview model for image generation.
Requires GOOGLE_API_KEY environment variable to be set.

Saves the generated infographic directly as an artifact using tool_context.save_artifact()
so it's accessible in adk web UI.
