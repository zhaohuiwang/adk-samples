# Machine Learning Engineering with Multiple Agents (MLE-STAR)

## Overview

The Machine Learning Engineering Agent is an approach to building Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) agents that can train state-of-the-art machine learning models on various tasks (including classification and regression tasks), through a novel approach of leveraging web search and targeted code block refinement. Using the example of predicting California housing prices, we show how MLE-STAR can create a regression model based on factors like population, income, etc. that outperforms traditional approaches to training ML models. The experimental results show that MLE-STAR achieves medals in 63.6% of the Kaggle competitions on the MLE-bench-Lite, significantly outperforming the best alternative. The implementation is based on the Google Cloud AI Research paper "MLE-STAR: Machine Learning Engineering Agent via Search and Targeted Refinement" (https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2506.15692).

### Key Features

1. **Initial Solution Generation:** Uses a search engine to retrieve state-of-the-art models and their example codes, then merges the best-performing candidates into a consolidated initial solution.

2. **Code Block Refinement:** Iteratively improves the solution by identifying and targeting specific code blocks (ML pipeline components) that have the most significant impact on performance, determined through ablation studies. An inner loop refines the targeted block with various strategies.

3. **Ensemble Strategies:** Introduces a novel ensembling method where the Agent proposes and refines ensemble strategies to combine multiple solutions, aiming for superior performance than individual best solutions.

4. **Robustness Modules:** Includes a debugging agent for error correction, a data leakage checker to prevent improper data access during preprocessing, and a data usage checker to ensure all provided data sources are utilized.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- uv for dependency management and packaging
  - See the official [uv website](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for installation.
  ```bash
  curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  ```
- Git
  - Git can be downloaded from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/). Then follow the [installation guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
- Google Cloud Account
  - You need a Google Cloud account
- A project on Google Cloud Platform
- Google Cloud CLI
  - For installation, please follow the instruction on the official
  [Google Cloud website](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

## Agent Starter Pack (recommended)

Use the [Agent Starter Pack](https://goo.gle/agent-starter-pack) to scaffold a production-ready project and choose your deployment target ([Vertex AI Agent Engine](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/overview) or [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run)), with CI/CD and other production features. The easiest way is with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (one command, no venv or pip install needed):

```bash
uvx agent-starter-pack create my-mle-agent -a adk@machine-learning-engineering
```

If you don't have uv yet: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`

The starter pack will prompt you to select deployment options and set up your Google Cloud project.

Alternative: Using pip and a virtual environment

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the starter pack and create your project
pip install --upgrade agent-starter-pack
agent-starter-pack create my-mle-agent -a adk@machine-learning-engineering
```



From your newly created project directory (e.g. `my-mle-agent`), run:

```bash
cd my-mle-agent
uv sync --dev
uv run adk run machine_learning_engineering
```

For the web UI:

```bash
uv run adk web
```

Then select `machine_learning_engineering` from the dropdown menu.

---

Alternative: Local development (run from this sample repo)

### Agent Setup

1. Clone the repository:
  ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/google/adk-samples.git
   cd adk-samples/python/agents/machine-learning-engineering
  ```
   For the rest of this tutorial **ensure you remain in the `python/agents/machine-learning-engineering` directory**.
2. Install the dependencies:
  ```bash
   uv sync
  ```

1. Configure settings:
  Set up Google Cloud credentials. You may set the following environment variables in your shell, or in a `.env` file instead.
   Authenticate your GCloud account.

### Running the Agent Locally

**Prepare your task**

You should prepare the inputs for your task in the following way:

1. Create a folder under `tasks` with the name of your task.
2. In that folder, create a file containing the description of the task.
3. Place the data files in this folder.

**Using `adk`**

ADK provides convenient ways to bring up agents locally and interact with them.
You may talk to the agent using the CLI:

```bash
adk run machine_learning_engineering
```

Or on a web interface:

```bash
adk web
```

The command `adk web` will start a web server on your machine and print the URL.

### Development

```bash
uv sync --dev
uv run pytest tests
uv run pytest eval
```

### Deployment

You will need to have specified a GCS bucket in the environment variable `GOOGLE_CLOUD_BUCKET` as detailed in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

If the bucket does not exist, ADK will create one for you. This is the easiest option. If the bucket does exist, then you must provide permissions to the service account as described in [this](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/troubleshooting/deploy#permission_errors) Troubleshooting article.

The Machine Learning Engineering Agent can be deployed to Vertex AI Agent Engine using the following
commands:

```bash
uv sync --group deployment
uv run deployment/deploy.py --create
```

When the deployment finishes, it will print a line like this:

```
Created remote agent: projects/<PROJECT_NUMBER>/locations/<PROJECT_LOCATION>/reasoningEngines/<AGENT_ENGINE_ID>
```

If you forget the AGENT_ENGINE_ID, you can list the existing agents using:

```bash
uv run deployment/deploy.py --list
```

The output will be like:

```
All remote agents:

123456789 ("machine_learning_engineering")
- Create time: 2025-07-11 09:46:07+00:00
- Update time: 2025-05-10 09:46:09+00:00
```

You may interact with the deployed agent using the `test_deployment.py` script

```bash
$ export USER_ID=<any string>
$ uv run deployment/test_deployment.py --resource_id=${AGENT_ENGINE_ID} --user_id=${USER_ID}
Found agent with resource ID: ...
Created session for user ID: ...
Type 'quit' to exit.
Input: Hello. What can you do for me?
Response: Hello! I'm a Machine Learning Engineer Assistant. I can help you achieve competition-level quality in solving machine learning tasks.

To get started, please provide the task description of the competition.
```

To delete the deployed agent, you may run the following command:

```bash
uv run deployment/deploy.py --delete --resource_id=${AGENT_ENGINE_ID}
```



### Example Interaction

You may open the URL, select "machine_learning_engineering" in the top-left drop-down menu, and
a chatbot interface will appear on the right. The conversation is initially
blank. Here are some example requests you may ask the Machine Learning Agent to identity itself:

> **[user]:** who are you?

> **[mle_frontdoor_agent]:** I am a machine learning engineer agent.

> **[user]:** what can you do?

> **[mle_frontdoor_agent]:** I am a machine learning engineer. My primary role is to engineer solutions for machine learning tasks, such as the California Housing Task. I can also describe the task if you'd like. I work by executing a sequence of sub-agents to solve the machine learning engineering task.

> **[user]:** describe the task that you have

> **[mle_frontdoor_agent]:** The task I have is the California Housing Task. This task involves predicting the median house value in California districts, given various features about those districts. It's a regression problem where the goal is to build a model that can accurately estimate house prices based on factors like population, median income, and housing age within a district.

> **[user]:** execute the task

> **[mle_frontdoor_agent]:** *intermediate output snipped*.
