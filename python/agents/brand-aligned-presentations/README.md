## 3. Architecture: How it Works

The agent operates as a coordinated pipeline, mimicking the workflow of a human consulting team:

1. **Planning & Research (Internal & External):**
   *   **Internal:** Queries Vertex AI Search for relevant IP and past proposals.
   *   **External:** Queries Google Search / Deep Research for current market context.
2. **Synthesis:** Organizes raw data into a coherent narrative aligned with the firm's value propositions.
3. **Deck Specification:** Generates a DeckSpec (JSON) defining the structure, slide content, targeted bolding, and speaker notes.
4. **Rendering:** Merges the DeckSpec with the corporate PowerPoint Template, generating high-quality images via Imagen 3 where requested.
5. **Output:** Uploads the final `.pptx` to Google Cloud Storage as a secure artifact,also available for direct download within the Gemini Enterprise interface.

- **Storage Object Admin** (`roles/storage.objectAdmin`): For reading templates/writing decks.
- **Service Account User** (`roles/iam.serviceAccountUser`): Required for Agent Engine deployment.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-repository-directory>
    ```

2. **Configure Environment**
    Create a `.env` file and populate it with your specific resources, following the template:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    **Required Variables:**
    - `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`: Your Google Cloud Project ID.
    - `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION`: The target region (e.g., `us-central1`).
    - `GEMINI_MODEL_NAME`: The spefcific LLM version to use (e.g., `gemini-2.5-flash`).
    - `IMAGE_GENERATION_MODEL`:The Imagen model version (e.g., `imagen-3.0-generate-002`).
    - `GCP_STAGING_BUCKET`: GCS Bucket name for storing artifacts (e.g., `gs://my-bucket`). If not provided, a new bucket named `YOUR_PROJECT_ID-staging-bucket` will be created in the `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION` (defaults to `us-central1`).
    - `DEFAULT_TEMPLATE_URI`: GCS URI of the master PowerPoint template (e.g., `gs://bucket/Proposal_Template.pptx`). If not provided, the default `docs/Proposal_Template.pptx` will be uploaded to your `GCP_STAGING_BUCKET` and used automatically.
    - `AS_APP`: The Gemini Enterprise App ID.
    - `DATASTORE_ID`: (Optional) Full path to the Vertex AI Search Datastore for internal RAG.(Format: `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/locations/{LOCATION}/collections/default_collection/dataStores/{DATA_STORE_ID}`).
    - `ENABLE_RAG`: (Default :false) Set to true to enable RAG database if DATASTORE_ID provided.
    - `ENABLE_DEEP_RESEARCH`: (Default:false) Requires project-level allowlisting before activation.
    - `MODEL_ARMOR_TEMPLATE_ID`: (Optional) The ID for the Model Armor security template to inspect model safety.

3. **Install Dependencies**
    Using `uv` (recommended):
    ```bash
    uv sync --dev
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```

### Alternative: Using Agent Starter Pack

You can also use the [Agent Starter Pack](https://goo.gle/agent-starter-pack) to create a production-ready version of this agent with additional deployment options:

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the starter pack and create your project
pip install --upgrade agent-starter-pack
agent-starter-pack create my-research-deck-agent -a adk@brand-aligned-presentations
```

<summary>⚡️ Alternative: Using uv</summary>

If you have [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed, you can create and set up your project with a single command:
```bash
uvx agent-starter-pack create my-research-deck-agent -a adk@brand-aligned-presentations
```
This command handles creating the project without needing to pre-install the package into a virtual environment.

## 6. Local Development & Testing

### Running the Agent Locally
Start the agent's web server locally:
```bash
uv run adk web --port 8000 .
```
You can now interact with the agent by sending prompts to `http://localhost:8000`.

### Evaluation & Testing
We use a dual-evaluation approach testing both structural integrity and narrative quality across the full lifecycle.

1. **Structural & Unit Tests (Pytest)**: Ensures the agent's internal logic, configuration, and PPTX rendering tools handle edge cases gracefully without crashing. Evaluates the `get_smart_layout` fallback logic.
    ```bash
    uv run pytest tests/
    ```

2. **End-to-End Lifecycle Evaluation**: A full mock session testing the multi-agent delegation, JSON generation, physical `.pptx` artifact creation, and subsequent interactive surgical edits. Evaluated via an LLM-as-a-judge framework.
    ```bash
    uv run python -m eval.eval_pipeline
    ```

## 7. Customization & Extension

### Modifying the Flow
- **Prompts:** Tweak the core orchestration logic and instructions in `presentation_agent/prompt.py`. This file controls the dual "Create" and "Edit" workflows.
- **Sub-Agents:** Modify sub-agent behaviors (Deep Research, Synthesis) in `presentation_agent/sub_agents/`.

### Adding Tools
To add new external APIs or utilities, place them in `presentation_agent/tools/` and register them as `FunctionTool` objects in the `agent_tools` array within `presentation_agent/agent.py`.

### User-Provided Templates 
Users can provide your own `.pptx` templates. To achieve flawless formatting without the Python engine resorting to programmatic resizing hacks, the provided template should follow (docs/pptx_template_guide.md)

## 8. Deployment to Agent Engine & Registration

#### 1. Deploy to Agent Engine
Use the `deploy.py` script located in the `deployment/` folder to containerize and push the agent.

**To Create a New App:**
```bash
uv run python deployment/deploy.py --mode create
```
*Note: This will automatically update the `AGENT_ENGINE_ID` in your `.env` file.*

**To Update an Existing App:**
```bash
uv run python deployment/deploy.py --mode update
```

#### 2. Register to Gemini Enterprise
Once deployed, register the agent so it can be discovered as a Tool/Agent in Gemini Enterprise.

1. Copy the configuration template:
    ```bash
    cd agent_registration.
    cp config_template.json config.json
    ```
2. Fill out `config.json` with your project details, app ID, and the Agent Engine ID (`adk_deployment_id`).
3. Run the registration wrapper:
    ```bash
    python as_registry_client.py register_agent --config config.json
    ```
