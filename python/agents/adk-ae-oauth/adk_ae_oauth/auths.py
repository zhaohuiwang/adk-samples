"""Authentication configuration for OAuth 2.0 with Google APIs.

Follows the pattern from:
https://fmind.medium.com/powering-up-your-agent-in-production-with-adk-oauth-and-gemini-enterprise-a52b0716fcba

In local dev (ADK Web UI): AUTH_CONFIG is used by the ADK OAuth flow
to prompt the user for consent and exchange the auth code for tokens.

In production (Agent Engine + Gemini Enterprise): The token is injected
by Gemini Enterprise into tool_context.state — AUTH_CONFIG is not used,
but TOKEN_CACHE_KEY and SCOPES are still referenced by negotiate_creds().
