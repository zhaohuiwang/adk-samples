# Policy-as-Code Agent

A generative AI-powered agent designed to automate data governance on Google Cloud. It allows users to define, validate, and enforce data policies using natural language queries, translating them into executable code that runs against **Google Cloud Dataplex** and **BigQuery** metadata.

The [Agent Starter Pack](https://goo.gle/agent-starter-pack) (ASP) is the **recommended** way to create a new project from this sample: you get deployment options and CI/CD scaffolding. The copy in [adk-samples](https://github.com/google/adk-samples) is the upstream source for browsing and contributions.

## Prerequisites

*   **Python 3.11+**
*   **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)** — fast Python package manager
*   **Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud`)** installed and authenticated
*   **Git**

### Recommended: Using Agent Starter Pack

The Agent Starter Pack is the recommended way to create and deploy a production-ready version of this agent. Start from a new directory (replace `my-policy-as-code` with your project name):

```bash
uvx agent-starter-pack create my-policy-as-code -a adk@policy-as-code
cd my-policy-as-code
```

Install dependencies (including dev tools for tests):

```bash
uv sync --group dev
```

1.  Copy the example configuration file:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2.  Open `.env` and fill in your details:
    *   `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`: Your Google Cloud Project ID.
    *   `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION`: (e.g., `us-central1`).
    *   `ENABLE_MEMORY_BANK`: Set to `True` to enable long-term memory (requires Firestore). Set to `False` to run without it. See [Memory Integration](./docs/MEMORY_INTEGRATION.md) for details.
    *   `FIRESTORE_DATABASE`: (Optional) Leave as `(default)` unless using a named database.

3.  Authenticate with Google Cloud:

    ```bash
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```

During setup, the starter pack will prompt you for deployment options and adds production-oriented tooling (for example automated CI/CD deployment scripts).

<summary>Alternative: install Agent Starter Pack with pip</summary>

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install --upgrade agent-starter-pack
agent-starter-pack create my-policy-as-code -a adk@policy-as-code
cd my-policy-as-code
```

Then continue with `uv sync --group dev` and the configuration steps above.

<details>
<summary>Clone this repository directly (contributors and advanced use)</summary>

Use this workflow when working against the upstream repository (for example to open a pull request). **New projects should still use the Agent Starter Pack** as described above.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/adk-samples.git
cd adk-samples/python/agents/policy-as-code
uv sync --group dev
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT, GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION, etc.
gcloud auth application-default login
```

Run the agent and tests with the same commands as in the recommended path (`uv run adk run`, `uv run adk web`, `uv run pytest`).

</details>

## Running the Agent

From your project directory (ASP-scaffolded or cloned repo):

```bash
uv run adk run policy_as_code_agent
```

Or use the web UI:

```bash
uv run adk web
```

**Optional:** To enable short-term contextual memory (Agent Engine) for better conversation history:

```bash
uv run adk web --memory_service_uri="agentengine://AGENT_ENGINE_ID"
```

Open the printed URL in your browser to chat with the agent.

## Running Tests

```bash
uv run pytest
```

Run only fast unit tests:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/unit -v
```

Integration tests are marked and may require GCP credentials and a configured `.env`.

## Key Features

*   **Natural Language Policies**: "All tables in the finance dataset must have a description."
*   **Hybrid Execution**: Generates Python code on-the-fly for flexibility, but executes it in a sandboxed environment for safety.
*   **Memory & Learning**: Uses **Firestore** and **Vector Search** to remember valid policies. If you ask a similar question later, it reuses the proven code instead of regenerating it.
*   **Dual-Mode Operation**:
    *   **Live Mode**: Queries the **Dataplex Universal Catalog** in real-time.
    *   **Offline Mode**: Analyzes metadata exports stored in **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**.
*   **Compliance Scorecards**: Run a full health check on your data assets with a single command.
*   **Remediation**: Can suggest specific fixes for identified violations.

## Architecture

The agent is built using the **Google Cloud Agent Development Kit (ADK)** and leverages several Google Cloud services:

*   **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: For complex code generation (converting natural language to Python).
*   **Gemini 2.5 Flash**: For conversational logic, tool selection, and remediation suggestions.
*   **Vertex AI Vector Search**: For semantic retrieval of past policies.
*   **Firestore**: Stores policy definitions, versions, and execution history.
*   **Dataplex API**: For fetching live metadata.

### Project Structure

*   `policy_as_code_agent/`
    *   `__init__.py`: Application Default Credentials and Vertex environment defaults for ASP/local runs.
    *   `agent.py`: Entry point and core agent definition.
    *   `memory.py`: Handles Firestore interactions (saving/retrieving policies).
    *   `utils/`: Utility modules for LLM logic, Dataplex, GCS, and common tools.
    *   `simulation.py`: Sandboxed execution engine for running policy code.
    *   `prompts/`: Markdown templates for LLM instructions.
*   `tests/`: Unit and integration tests.
*   `data/`: Sample metadata for local testing.
