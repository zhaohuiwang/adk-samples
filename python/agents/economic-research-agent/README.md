## A. Overview & Functionalities

The **Economic Research Agent (ERA)** is a production-grade site-selection and market intelligence consultant. Designed for corporate research, ERA automates comparative metropolitan cost-modeling by orchestrating live public APIs (FRED, BLS, CENSUS, HUD, EIA) into McKinsey-style strategic briefs—now upgraded with an automated **Auditor Judge Agent** (via Serper Live Search) for zero-hallucination verification.

### 📊 Agent Details

| Feature | Specifics |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Interaction Type** | Conversational / Strategic Consultant |
| **Complexity** | Advanced (Multi-Source Synthesis) |
| **Agent Type** | Single Agent (ADK Class-Based) |
| **Vertical** | Economic Development / Real Estate / Finance |
| **Grounding** | 100% Live-API (FRED, BLS, HUD, Census, BEA) |

### 💬 Example Interaction (Strategic Consulting)

**User**: "Compare Austin and Raleigh for a new data center HQ."

**ERA**: "I am analyzing technical and fiscal ROI for NAICS 518210 (Data Processing). 
1. **Utility Benchmarking**: Texas (ERCOT) industrial rates average 8.2c/kWh, while North Carolina (Duke Energy) is 7.5c/kWh.
2. **Talent Pipeline**: UT Austin graduated 1,200 CS majors in 2023 vs. 850 from NC State.
3. **Fiscal Climate**: NC has a scheduled corporate tax phasedown to 0% by 2030, offering a better longitudinal OPEX profile.
*Recommendation: Raleigh for long-term tax stability; Austin for immediate talent density.*"

### 🛠️ Installation

ERA uses `uv` for lightning-fast dependency management.

```bash
# Create and synchronize the virtual environment
uv sync --dev
```

### ☁️ Google Cloud Setup (Prerequisites)

Before deploying to the Vertex AI Reasoning Engine, ensure your local environment is authenticated with Google Cloud:

1. **Install the Google Cloud CLI**: Follow the [installation guide](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).
2. **Set your active project**:
   ```bash
   gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
   ```
3. **Authenticate your credentials**:
   ```bash
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```

### 📦 Using Agent Starter Pack (Recommended)

We highly recommend setting up and deploying this agent using the [Agent Starter Pack (ASP)](https://goo.gle/agent-starter-pack). ASP provides a production-ready framework that includes:
- **Automated CI/CD Pipelines**: Pre-configured GitHub Actions for streamlined Vertex AI deployments.
- **Standardized Structure**: Adheres to Google Cloud best practices for modular agent repositories.
- **Interactive CLI Setup**: Guides you through provisioning staging buckets and Vertex AI resources automatically.

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate

# Install the starter pack and create your project
pip install --upgrade agent-starter-pack
agent-starter-pack create my-economic-research-agent -a adk@economic-research-agent
```

<details>
<summary>⚡️ Alternative: Using uv</summary>

If you have [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed, you can create and setup your project with a single command:
```bash
uvx agent-starter-pack create my-economic-research-agent -a adk@economic-research-agent
```
</details>

### 🚀 Running the Agent

ERA offers multiple interaction protocols:

```bash
# 🧠 Option 1: Interactive CLI Session (Standard)
make run

# 🛰️ Option 2: Multi-Protocol MCP Server (For Claude/Cursor)
make mcp
```

## D. Customization & Extension

The ERA is designed for modular growth:
- **Modifying the Persona**: Edit `economic_research/prompt.py` to change the consultative tone.
- **Adding New Skills**: Add your skill in `economic_research/tools/`, then register it in `economic_research/agent.py`.
- **Altering Data Flows**: Use the `shared_libraries/helper.py` to add new HTTP/JSON normalization patterns for regional data.

---

## E. Evaluation

How do we know ERA is accurate?
- **Golden Suite**: We use a 21-question integration suite (`tests/integration/`) targeting specific NAICS scenarios.
- **Grounding Fidelity Metric**: The `eval/run_eval.py` script uses **LLM-as-a-Judge** (Gemini 3.1 Pro) to verify if the output contains actual numerical data from the APIs.
- **Regression Testing**: `pytest` handles unit-level verification of API response parsing.

```bash
# Run the full 21-question validation suite
uv run pytest tests/integration/test_full_golden_suite.py
```

---

## F. Deploy

### 🚀 Production Rollout

The ERA is built for the **Vertex AI Reasoning Engine** (ADK 2.0).

```bash
# 🌍 Step 1: Deploy to Google Cloud (Reasoning Engine)
make deploy
```

### 🔒 Cloud-Native Security & Privacy

The ERA is engineered for **Enterprise Privacy** within the Google Cloud perimeter:
- **Zero Data Retention**: No local databases or static tables are used. Data is processed in-memory.
- **Key-Safe Architecture**: Secrets are managed via `.env` or Google Secret Manager.
