# YouTube Analyst Agent

The YouTube Analyst Agent is a powerful Gemini-powered assistant designed to provide deep insights into YouTube content, channel performance, and audience engagement. It leverages the YouTube Data API to retrieve real-time data and uses Gemini's reasoning capabilities to analyze trends, sentiment, and metrics.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Agent Starter Pack)

To create a production-ready project based on this agent, run the following command:

```bash
uvx agent-starter-pack create my-youtube-analyst -a adk@youtube-analyst
```

This will set up a complete project with:
*   **Infrastructure:** Terraform scripts for Google Cloud resources.
*   **CI/CD:** Automated deployment pipelines (Cloud Build or GitHub Actions).
*   **Management:** Built-in scripts for deployment and verification.

## Overview

This agent assists marketers, content creators, and researchers in understanding the YouTube landscape. It serves as a comprehensive demonstration of two key ADK capabilities:

1.  **Extensive YouTube API Integration:** Demonstrates how to orchestrate multiple complex API calls (search, video details, channel stats, comments) into a seamless conversational flow.
2.  **Interactive Visualizations with ADK:** Showcases the use of a specialized sub-agent to dynamically generate and execute Python code to produce interactive Plotly charts as artifacts within the ADK environment.

*   **Tools:**
    *   `search_youtube`: Finds videos matching specific queries and date filters.
    *   `get_video_details`: Retrieves comprehensive stats (views, likes, comments) for video IDs.
    *   `get_channel_details`: Fetches subscriber counts and total view metrics for channels.
    *   `get_video_comments`: Downloads top-level comments for sentiment analysis.
    *   `calculate_engagement_metrics`: Computes engagement and active rates.
    *   `analyze_sentiment_heuristic`: Performs keyword-based sentiment scoring on text.
    *   `render_html`: Renders HTML content (used for reports).
    *   `execute_visualization_code`: Executes generated plotting code to produce artifacts.
    *   `store_youtube_api_key`: Stores the user-provided API key for the session.

```

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.13**: The project is pinned to this version for stability and feature compatibility.
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/): Used for fast dependency management and virtual environment creation.
- **Google Cloud Project**: Required for Vertex AI and Gemini model access.
- **YouTube Data API key**: You will be prompted to provide this in the chat during your first interaction.

### Installation (Local Development)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/google/adk-samples.git
    cd adk-samples/python/agents/youtube-analyst
    ```

2.  **Install the environment:**
    ```bash
    make install
    ```

3.  **Configure Credentials:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Edit `.env` and set `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` and `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=global`.

### Running the Agent

**Web Interface (Recommended):**
```bash
make web
```
Select `youtube_analyst` from the agent selection menu.

**Command Line Interface:**
```bash
make cli
```

### Deployment (Advanced)

For users who want to deploy the agent as a managed service, we provide automated deployment scripts that rely on the [Agent Starter Pack (ASP)](https://goo.gle/agent-starter-pack).

- **Deploy to Vertex AI Agent Engine:**
  ```bash
  ./deployment/deploy-to-agent-engine.sh
  ```
- **Deploy to Google Cloud Run:**
  ```bash
  ./deployment/deploy-to-cloud-run.sh
  ```
- **Deploy to Gemini Enterprise:**
  ```bash
  ./deployment/deploy-to-gemini-enterprise.sh
  ```

*Note: These scripts use `uvx` and have built-in hermetic safeguards (`UV_NO_CONFIG=1`) to ensure reliable installation of the required deployment tools from the public PyPI registry.*

## Onboarding: YouTube API Key

This agent requires a YouTube Data API v3 key. To maintain security and allow for frictionless setup, YouBuddy features an interactive onboarding flow:

1.  Apply for a key at [Google Developers Console](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started).
2.  When the agent detects a missing key, it will provide instructions.
3.  Paste your key into the chat.
4.  The agent securely stores the key in the session state using the `store_youtube_api_key` tool.

## Example Interactions

- **Trend Analysis:** "Find the top 5 videos about 'Generative AI' from the last month and plot their view counts."
- **Competitor Research:** "Compare the engagement rates of MKBHD and Linus Tech Tips."
- **Audience Feedback:** "What is the sentiment of the comments on the latest OpenAI video? Summarize the top concerns."
- **Visual Reporting:** "Create a bar chart comparing the subscriber counts of the top 3 tech reviewers."

### Sample Trace (Under the Hood)

Here is what happens when you ask: *"Compare the engagement on the latest video from Running HK."*

```text
[User]: Compare the engagement on the latest video from Running HK.

[youtube_agent]: Calling tool `search_youtube`...
Arguments: {"query": "Running HK", "max_results": 1}

[Tool Output]: [{"title": "HK100 2024 Highlights", "videoId": "AbCdEfGhIjK", "channelTitle": "Running HK"}]

[youtube_agent]: Calling tool `get_video_details`...
Arguments: {"video_ids": ["AbCdEfGhIjK"]}

[Tool Output]: [{"videoId": "AbCdEfGhIjK", "viewCount": "50000", "likeCount": "2500", "commentCount": "150", ...}]

[youtube_agent]: Calling tool `calculate_engagement_metrics`...
Arguments: {"view_count": 50000, "like_count": 2500, "comment_count": 150}

[Tool Output]: {"engagement_rate": 5.3, "active_rate": 0}

[youtube_agent]: The latest video from Running HK has an engagement rate of 5.3%. Would you like me to visualize this against other running KOLs?
```

## Customization

- **Add New Metrics:** Extend `tools.py` to calculate custom metrics like "views per subscriber" or "comment-to-like ratio."
- **Enhance Sentiment:** Replace the heuristic sentiment tool in `tools.py` with a call to the Gemini API for more nuanced analysis of comments.
- **Database Integration:** Modify `tools.py` to save analysis results to BigQuery or a local SQL database for long-term tracking.

## Troubleshooting

- **API Errors:** If you see "Quota Exceeded" or 403 errors, ensure your key is valid and has the YouTube Data API v3 enabled.
- **Python Version**: If `uv sync` fails, ensure you have Python 3.13 installed (e.g., via `pyenv` or `brew install python@3.13`).
- **Visualization Failures:** If a chart fails to render, ask the agent to "try again." The visualization agent writes code dynamically, and a retry often fixes syntax issues.
