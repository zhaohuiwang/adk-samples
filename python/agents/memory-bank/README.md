# ADK Memory Bank Sample

An [ADK](https://adk.dev/) agent with [Memory Bank](https://docs.cloud.google.com/agent-builder/agent-engine/memory-bank/set-up) integration that remembers user preferences and facts across sessions. Deployable to Vertex AI Agent Engine or Cloud Run.

## Example Interactions

Memory Bank shines in multi-session conversations. Here are some examples showing how memories are saved and recalled:

**Session 1** — tell the agent about yourself:
```
You: I live in Austin, Texas.
Agent: Got it! Austin is a great city — known for its live music scene and BBQ. Let me know if you need anything Austin-related!
```

**Session 2** — the agent remembers without being reminded:
```
You: What's the weather like?
Agent: Here's the current weather for Austin, Texas: It's 90 degrees and sunny.
```

**Session 1** — set a preference:
```
You: I want you to talk like a pirate from now on.
Agent: Aye aye, captain! Consider it done — I'll be speakin' in the tongue of the seven seas from here on out! What be yer next command?
```

**Session 2** — the preference persists:
```
You: What can you help me with?
Agent: Ahoy, matey! I can help ye with weather reports, tellin' the time, and rememberin' all manner of facts about ye. What treasure of knowledge be ye seekin' today?
```

These work because:
- `PreloadMemoryTool` retrieves "lives in Austin" and "wants pirate speak" at the start of each turn
- `generate_memories_callback` extracts those facts after the first session
- Memory Bank consolidates them so they're available in every future session

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.10+**
- **uv** — Python package manager ([Install](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/))
- **Google Cloud SDK** — `gcloud` CLI ([Install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install))
- Google Cloud project with billing enabled

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
uv sync --dev
```

### Step 2: Authenticate with Google Cloud
```bash
gcloud auth login
gcloud auth application-default login
gcloud config set project <your-project-id>
```

### Step 3: Run Locally
```bash
make playground
```
This launches the ADK Web UI on port 8501. Select the `app` folder to interact with your agent.

When running locally, ADK uses `InMemoryMemoryService` — memories won't persist across restarts. To test against a real Memory Bank instance:
```bash
uv run adk web . --port 8501 --memory_service_uri=agentengine://<AGENT_ENGINE_RESOURCE_NAME>
```

## Cloud Deployment Options

After completing the initial setup, you have two deployment options:

### Option A: Deploy to Vertex AI Agent Engine

Agent Engine provides fully managed infrastructure — session management, memory, and scaling are handled automatically.

```bash
make deploy-agent-engine
```

This runs `app/app_utils/deploy.py`, which:
1. Reads `memory_bank_config` from `agent_engine_app.py`
2. Wraps it in a `ReasoningEngineContextSpec`
3. Passes it via `context_spec` in the `AgentEngineConfig`
4. Creates or updates the Agent Engine instance with Memory Bank configured

Entry point: `app/agent_engine_app.py` (`AgentEngineApp`, a subclass of `AdkApp`)

### Option B: Deploy to Cloud Run

Cloud Run gives you full control over the serving infrastructure — custom endpoints, middleware, container environment.

```bash
make deploy-cloud-run
```

On first startup, the Cloud Run service will:
1. Find or create an Agent Engine instance for session and memory storage
2. If creating, pass `memory_bank_config` via `context_spec` to enable Memory Bank
3. Set `session_service_uri` and `memory_service_uri` to the same `agentengine://` URI
4. Start the FastAPI server with both services wired up

Entry point: `app/fast_api_app.py` (FastAPI via `get_fast_api_app()`)

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `make install` | Install dependencies using uv |
| `make playground` | Launch local dev playground (ADK Web UI) |
| `make deploy-agent-engine` | Deploy to Vertex AI Agent Engine |
| `make deploy-cloud-run` | Deploy to Cloud Run |
| `make local-server` | Run FastAPI server locally with hot-reload |
| `make lint` | Run code quality checks |

### Alternative: Using Agent Starter Pack

You can also use the [Agent Starter Pack](https://goo.gle/agent-starter-pack) to create a production-ready version of this agent with additional deployment options:

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the starter pack and create your project
pip install --upgrade agent-starter-pack
agent-starter-pack create my-memory-bank -a adk@memory-bank
```

<details>
<summary>⚡️ Alternative: Using uv</summary>

If you have [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed, you can create and set up your project with a single command:
```bash
uvx agent-starter-pack create my-memory-bank -a adk@memory-bank
```
This command handles creating the project without needing to pre-install the package into a virtual environment.

</details>

The starter pack will prompt you to select deployment options and provides additional production-ready features including automated CI/CD deployment scripts.
