# Engine Runtime, it sends session events to VertexAiMemoryBankService, which
# extracts user preferences and facts for retrieval in future sessions.
#
# Alternative: use callback_context.add_events_to_memory(events=...) to send
# only a subset of events, which is better for incremental processing.
# See: https://docs.cloud.google.com/agent-builder/agent-engine/memory-bank/quickstart-adk
