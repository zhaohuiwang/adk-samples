"""Blog Skills Agent — Demonstrates 4 ways to use ADK Skills.

This agent showcases:
  1. Inline skills (models.Skill) — SEO checklist defined in code
  2. File-based skills (load_skill_from_dir) — Blog writer loaded from directory
  3. External skills — Content research skill loaded from a downloaded repo
  4. Meta skills — A skill-creator that generates new SKILL.md definitions
