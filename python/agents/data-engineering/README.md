## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.10+
-   uv for dependency management and packaging
    -   See the official [uv website](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for installation.
    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```
-   A project on Google Cloud Platform
-   Google Cloud CLI
    -   For installation, please follow the instruction on the official
        [Google Cloud website](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

## Agent Starter Pack (recommended)

Use the [Agent Starter Pack](https://goo.gle/agent-starter-pack) to scaffold a production-ready project and choose your deployment target ([Vertex AI Agent Engine](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/overview) or [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run)), with CI/CD and other production features. The easiest way is with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (one command, no venv or pip install needed):

```bash
uvx agent-starter-pack create my-data-engineering-agent -a adk@data-engineering
```

If you don't have uv yet: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`

The starter pack will prompt you to select deployment options and set up your Google Cloud project.

<details>
<summary>Alternative: Using pip and a virtual environment</summary>

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the starter pack and create your project
pip install --upgrade agent-starter-pack
agent-starter-pack create my-data-engineering-agent -a adk@data-engineering
```

</details>

From your newly created project directory (e.g. `my-data-engineering-agent`), configure your environment and run:

```bash
cd my-data-engineering-agent
cp data_engineering_agent/.env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Google Cloud project, Dataform repository, and workspace settings
uv sync --dev
uv run adk run data_engineering_agent
```

For the web UI:

```bash
uv run adk web
```

Then select `data_engineering_agent` from the dropdown menu.

<summary>Alternative: Local development (run from this sample repo)</summary>

### Agent Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/google/adk-samples.git
    cd adk-samples/python/agents/data-engineering
    ```
    For the rest of this tutorial **ensure you remain in the `python/agents/data-engineering` directory**.
2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

3.  **Configuration**

    Create a `.env` file from the provided template and fill in your settings:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Edit the `.env` file with your configuration (see `.env.example` for all available options):

### Environment Variables

-   `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`: Your Google Cloud Project ID (preferred) or use
    `GCP_PROJECT_ID`
-   `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION`: Location for Vertex AI, Dataform, and BigQuery
    (default: us-central1)
-   `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI`: Set to 1 to use Vertex AI (default: 0)
-   `ROOT_AGENT_MODEL`: Model to use for the root agent (default:
    gemini-2.5-pro)
-   `DATAFORM_REPOSITORY_NAME`: Your Dataform repository name
-   `DATAFORM_WORKSPACE_NAME`: Your Dataform workspace name

### Running the Agent Locally

Run ADK from the upper folder: `cd .. adk web` or `adk run`

### Example

    # Prompt
    Enrich the `new_york_taxi_trips.tlc_green_trips_2022` table by generating date and time features from the `pickup_datetime` column. Use `new_york_taxi_trips` dataset for the enriched table.

    # Agent Response
    Of course. I will enrich the tlc_green_trips_2022 table by creating a new table with additional date and time features from the pickup_datetime column.

    First, I need to get information about the existing table to ensure I have the correct column names and data types.

    I have created a new table named enriched_trips in the new_york_taxi_trips dataset. This table includes the original data from tlc_green_trips_2022 plus the following new columns:

    pickup_date: The date of the pickup.
    pickup_day_of_week: The day of the week of the pickup (e.g., Sunday, Monday).
    pickup_hour_of_day: The hour of the day of the pickup.
    I have also added the declaration file for the source table.

    I will now compile the project to view the DAG.

    I have successfully compiled the Dataform project. The compilation was successful, and I have the pipeline's DAG.

### Development

```bash
uv sync --dev
uv run pytest tests
uv run pytest eval
```

`tests` runs the agent on a sample request, and makes sure that every component
is functional. `eval` is a demonstration of how to evaluate the agent, using the
`AgentEvaluator` in ADK. It sends a couple requests to the agent and expects
that the agent's responses match a pre-defined response reasonably well.

### Deployment

The Data Engineering Agent can be deployed to Vertex AI Agent Engine using the following
commands:

```bash
uv sync --group deployment
uv run deployment/deploy.py --create
```

When the deployment finishes, it will print a line like this:

```
Created remote agent: projects/<PROJECT_NUMBER>/locations/<PROJECT_LOCATION>/reasoningEngines/<AGENT_ENGINE_ID>
```

If you forget the AGENT_ENGINE_ID, you can list the existing agents using:

```bash
uv run deployment/deploy.py --list
```

The output will be like:

```
All remote agents:

123456789 ("data_engineering_agent")
- Create time: 2025-08-05 12:35:34.245431+00:00
- Update time: 2025-08-05 12:36:01.421432+00:00
```

You may interact with the deployed agent using the `test_deployment.py` script

```bash
$ export USER_ID=<any string>
$ uv run deployment/test_deployment.py --resource_id=${AGENT_ENGINE_ID} --user_id=${USER_ID}
Found agent with resource ID: ...
Created session for user ID: ...
Type 'quit' to exit.
Input: Hello, what can you do for me?
Response: 
```

To delete the deployed agent, you may run the following command:

```bash
uv run deployment/deploy.py --delete --resource_id=${AGENT_ENGINE_ID}
```
