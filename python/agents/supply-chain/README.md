# Supply Chain Agent

## Overview

This agent sample implements a system of autonomous AI agents designed using Google ADK framework to analyse real-time market dynamics, weather conditions, internal consumption & generation capacities and demand forecasts. These agents then forward their individual outputs which is cumulatively factored in to suggest optimisations for the current supply chain (e.g. resource procurement if demand is going to peak).

**Domain**: `Power and Energy`

Key System Capabilities:

- **Analyze Real-Time External Events**: Continuously scans and interprets public news, weather forecasts, and commodity prices to identify external risks and opportunities.
- **Monitor Internal Operations**: Accesses and analyzes private, internal data (e.g., generation capacity, supplier yields, inventory) using natural language.
- **Predictive Demand Forecasts**: Leverages historical data to accurately predict future energy demand.
- **Provide Holistic Optimization**: Synthesizes insights from all data streams (internal, external, and predictive) to recommend concrete, actionable supply chain strategies.
- **Deliver Dynamic Visualizations**: Automatically generates charts to make complex data and forecasts easy to understand.

## Architecture

![architecture](./supply-chain-agent-architecture.png)

The above architecture outlines an intelligent, mulit-agent-based workflow for processing a user's query for supply chain optimization.

The Supply Chain Agent then **delegates tasks to multiple specialized sub-agents** that function as a coordinated team, with each agent handling a specialized role to analyze, predict, and optimize the supply chain.

- 🧠 Supply Chain Agent (The Orchestrator): Receives user queries, coordinates all sub-agents, and synthesizes their findings into a final, actionable recommendation.

- 🌐 MarketPulse Agent (The Sentinel): Scans the external world for risks for real-time information using **Google Search Tool**.

- 🏭 OpsInsight Agent (The Producer): Monitors internal capacity, inventory, and production data by querying internal BigQuery database using **Natural Language-to-SQL Tool**.

- 📈 DemandSense Agent (The Forecaster): Analyses historical data and market signals to predict future customer demand with a **Forecasting Tool**.

- 🌤️Weather Reporting Agent (The Weather Analyst): Analyses weather pattern (based on WeatherNext forecast data) to detect potential logistic disruptions, transportation, and route risks using **Weather Toolkit**.

- 📊 Chart Generator Agent (The Visualizer): Creates dynamic charts from the analyzed data using a **VertexAI Code Executor Tool** to aid in decision-making.

Along with these specialized sub agents, agent also uses **Get Current Date & Time as a Function Tool** to check the current date & time for specific timezone

## Testing and Evaluation

To run the test and evaluation, you need a few additional dependencies. Run
the following uv command from the `agents/supply-chain` directory to install them:

```bash
uv sync
```

1. Running Tests

Tests assess the overall executability of the agents.
The tests can be run from the `agents/supply-chain` directory using
the `pytest` module.

```bash
uv run --extra dev pytest tests
```

`tests` runs the agent on a sample request, and makes sure that every component
is functional.

2. Running Evaluations

Evaluations assess the quality of the agent's responses.
The evaluations can be run from the `agents/supply-chain` directory using
the `pytest` module:

```bash
uv run --extra dev pytest eval
```

`eval` is a demonstration of how to evaluate the agent, using the
`AgentEvaluator` in ADK. It sends a couple requests to the agent and expects
that the agent's responses match a pre-defined response reasonably well.

## Deployment on VertexAI Agent Engine

0. Initial Setup
   To deploy the agent to Google VertexAI Agent Engine, first follow these steps to set up your Google Cloud project for Agent Engine.

You also need to give BigQuery User, BigQuery Data Viewer, and Vertex AI User permissions to the Reasoning Engine Service Agent. Run the following commands to grant the required permissions:

```bash
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_NUMBER=<your-project-number>
export RE_SA="service-${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_NUMBER}@gcp-sa-aiplatform-re.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT} \
    --member="serviceAccount:${RE_SA}" \
    --condition=None \
    --role="roles/bigquery.user"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT} \
    --member="serviceAccount:${RE_SA}" \
    --condition=None \
    --role="roles/bigquery.dataViewer"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT} \
    --member="serviceAccount:${RE_SA}" \
    --condition=None \
    --role="roles/aiplatform.user"
```

In order to inherit all dependencies of your agent you can build the wheel file of the agent and run the deployment.

1.  **Build Supply Chain Agent WHL file**

    ```bash
    uv build --wheel --out-dir deployment
    ```

2.  **Deploy the agent to agent engine**
    It is important to run deploy.py from within deployment folder so paths are correct

    ```bash
    cd deployment
    uv run python deploy.py --create
    ```

When this command returns, if it succeeds it will print an AgentEngine resource
name that looks something like this:

```
projects/************/locations/us-central1/reasoningEngines/7737333693403889664
```

The last sequence of digits is the AgentEngine resource ID.

3.  **Test the agent deployed in agent engine**

    Once you have successfully deployed your agent to agent engine, you can interact with it
    using the `test_deployment.py` script in the `deployment` directory. Store the
    agent's resource ID in an environment variable and run the following command:

    ```bash
    export RESOURCE_ID=...
    export USER_ID=<any string>
    python test_deployment.py --resource_id=$RESOURCE_ID --user_id=$USER_ID
    ```

    The session will look something like this:

    ```
    Found agent with resource ID: ...
    Created session for user ID: ...
    Type 'quit' to exit.
    Input: Hello. What data do you have?
    Response: I have access to the train and test tables inside the
    forecasting_sticker_sales dataset.
    ...
    ```

    Note that this is _not_ a full-featured, production-ready CLI; it is just
    intended to show how to use the Agent Engine API to interact with a deployed
    agent. ```

4.  **Delete the agent deployed in agent engine**

    ```bash
    uv run python deploy.py --delete --resource_id=$RESOURCE_ID
    ```

## Deployment on Cloud Run

```bash
# source the .env file
source .env
# add requirements.txt to the supply_chain directory
cp requirements.txt supply_chain/
# add .env to the supply_chain directory
cp .env supply_chain/
# run the deployment script
bash deployment/cloud_run.sh
```

Once deployed, you can update the service with the following command:

```bash
gcloud run services update $SERVICE_NAME --memory 4Gi --min-instances 1 --region $GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION_CLOUD_RUN
```

### Testing deployment

This code snippet is an example of how to test the deployed agent.

```
import vertexai
from vertexai import agent_engines

vertexai.init(
    project="<GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION_PROJECT_ID>",
    location="<GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION>"
)

# get the agent based on resource id
agent_engine = agent_engines.get('DEPLOYMENT_RESOURCE_NAME') # looks like this projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/reasoningEngines/REASONING_ENGINE_ID

for event in remote_agent.stream_query(
    user_id=USER_ID,
    session_id=session["id"],
    message="Hello!",
):
    print(event)

```
