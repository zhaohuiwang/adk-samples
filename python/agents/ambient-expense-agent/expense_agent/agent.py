"""Ambient agent that processes expense report emails.

This agent receives expense events via ADK trigger endpoints (Pub/Sub)
and routes them through a graph-based workflow:

- Expenses under $100 are auto-approved immediately.
- Expenses of $100 or more are flagged by an LLM review agent, then
  paused for human approval via ADK 2.0's RequestInput (HITL).

Built with ADK 2.0 graph-based workflows to demonstrate conditional
routing, function nodes, mixed agent/function graphs, and human-in-the-
loop approval.
