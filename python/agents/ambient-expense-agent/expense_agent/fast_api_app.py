"""FastAPI entry point for the ambient expense agent backend.

This file configures the ADK web server with Pub/Sub trigger endpoints
enabled, allowing the agent to process expense reports autonomously
when deployed to Cloud Run.

The frontend service queries the ADK's built-in session APIs
(``GET /apps/{app}/users/{user}/sessions``) to find pending approvals.

Includes middleware to normalize Pub/Sub subscription names from their
fully-qualified resource paths (``projects/.../subscriptions/NAME``)
to short names, keeping user IDs clean and readable in session records.
