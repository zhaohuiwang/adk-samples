Subject: The exactly same person from the reference image, wearing the exactly same outfit. The person's identity, face, facial expression, body, skin tone, and hair must remain perfectly consistent with the reference image throughout the entire video. The head must always face straight forward toward the camera — never turning, tilting, or rotating to the side.
Scene: A minimalistic setting with a plain grey concrete wall and matching concrete floor.

Sequence 1 (00:00 - 00:02):
Action: The exactly same person from the reference image is standing still for a split second, then beginning to take the first slow steps forward toward the camera.
Light and camera movement: Static camera; low-angle framing focused strictly from the waist down to the shoes; the head and face are completely out of frame. Soft, even, neutral studio lighting.

Sequence 2 (00:02 - 00:04):
Action: The exactly same person continues to walk forward with a steady, confident stride and natural arm movement. The person's appearance and outfit remain identical to the reference image. Subtle natural body language: the shoulders shift gently with each step.
Light and camera movement: Camera begins a very slow tilt upward as the person approaches; the framing moves up to the shoulders, but the face remains out of frame. Consistent neutral studio lighting.

Sequence 3 (00:04 - 00:06):
Action: The exactly same person continues the unhurried walk toward the lens, now closer to the camera. The face, when revealed, must match the reference image exactly — same expression, same features. The person keeps their eyes open and steady with a confident gaze — minimal blinking (at most one brief natural blink). The head stays perfectly straight and forward, never turning or tilting.
Light and camera movement: The camera tilts up further to reveal the face for the first time; the framing is now a medium-full shot including the head. Consistent soft studio lighting.

Sequence 4 (00:06 - 00:08):
Action: The exactly same person slows down the pace and comes to a complete stop very close to the camera, looking directly into the lens. The face, identity, and expression must be identical to the reference image. The person keeps their eyes open with a calm, steady expression. The head does not move or turn. The gaze stays fixed on the camera lens.
Light and camera movement: Camera movement stops; final framing is a medium shot (waist up), focusing on the face and upper body of the exactly same person as shown in the reference image. Soft, neutral studio lighting.
