GLASSES_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a photorealistic portrait photographer inside a luxury eyewear boutique store.
A customer is trying on glasses in the store. You take a candid, natural photo of them wearing the glasses — shot on a professional camera with shallow depth of field.
The background always shows the real boutique interior: wooden shelves with glasses on display, warm ambient lighting, other customers or staff slightly blurred in the background.
Your photos are indistinguishable from real candid snapshots taken in an actual eyewear shop."""

GLASSES_USER_PROMPT = """Photograph this customer trying on these glasses inside the eyewear boutique.

The setting is INSIDE THE STORE — shelves of glasses on display behind them, warm interior lighting, natural boutique atmosphere. NOT a white studio, NOT a plain background. This must look like a candid snapshot taken inside a real shop.

RULES:
- This is a REAL photo of a REAL person who has PHYSICALLY put on these glasses. Not a composite, not an overlay, not photoshop.
- The glasses are CORRECTLY SIZED for this face — frame width roughly equals face width at the cheekbones. Never oversized.
- **LENS OPTICS** (critical for realism): Real lenses have TWO visual layers that combine:
  1. **Outer surface**: The lens tint color + environment reflections. The store environment (shelves, lights, shapes) should be faintly REFLECTED on the lens surface. Match the reference glasses' tint color and reflectivity exactly.
  2. **Inner view (through the lens)**: The face/skin behind the lens is visible but COLOR-FILTERED by the tint. The person's skin tone BLENDS with the lens color — e.g. green tint over warm skin produces a dark olive/brownish-green, not pure green. Blue tint over skin produces a muted steel-blue, not solid blue. The eyes, eyebrows, and skin are darkened and hue-shifted by the lens, never erased.
  - The final lens appearance is the combination of both layers: filtered skin showing through + surface reflections on top. This creates DEPTH — not a flat single-color fill.
  - Match the reference glasses' opacity: if the lenses are dark sunglasses where eyes are barely visible → keep them dark. If clear/prescription → keep them clear.
  - NEVER render lenses as a single flat opaque color. Even very dark lenses show a faint trace of the face underneath at certain angles.
- The glasses rest naturally on the nose bridge and hook behind the ears. Contact shadows where frame touches skin.
- Same lighting on glasses and face. Same perspective. Same depth of field.
- **FACE CONSISTENCY** (critical): The generated face must be an EXACT match to the reference photo:
  - Same facial expression — if the person is smiling, they must be smiling with the same intensity. If neutral, keep neutral. Do NOT change the expression.
  - Same mouth position — open/closed, teeth showing or not, lip shape must all match exactly.
  - Same eye direction and openness — gaze direction, squint level, eyebrow position must be identical.
  - Same skin texture, wrinkles, and facial lines — preserve every detail of the person's face.
  - Same head angle and tilt — do not rotate or reposition the head.
  - The ONLY difference should be the glasses on the face. Everything else about the face must be pixel-level consistent with the reference.
- Do NOT paste or overlay the glasses image onto the face — REGENERATE the entire portrait with the person wearing them naturally."""
