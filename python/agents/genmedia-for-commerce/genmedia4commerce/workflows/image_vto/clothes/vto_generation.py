The result must look like a single cohesive photograph, never like a cut-out pasted onto a background."""

    user_task = f"""### TASK: FULL BODY VIRTUAL TRY-ON & RESTORATION

Dress the model in the provided garments and generate a **full body head-to-toe shot**:

1. **PRESERVE IDENTITY & ANATOMY** - Keep the exact pose, body shape, body size, facial features, and skin tone. Do NOT make the person thinner or change their body proportions in any way.
2. **REPLACE THE CLOTHES** - Fit the provided garments naturally onto the model. Adapt the garment size to the person's actual body — the clothes should look like they fit this specific person, not like the person was changed to fit the clothes.
3. **FULL BODY FRAMING** - The image MUST show the entire person from head to feet. Do NOT crop at the knees or waist. The feet and shoes must be visible at the bottom of the frame.
4. **COMPLETE THE OUTFIT** - If not all garments are provided (e.g. only a coat), add appropriate complementary clothing (pants, shoes, etc.) that matches the style and formality of the provided garments. For example: elegant coat → dress shoes and tailored trousers, casual jacket → sneakers and jeans. The entire outfit must look cohesive.
5. **IMAGE RESTORATION** - Denoise the subject and correct any jagged masking edges or artifacts to ensure a seamless, high-fidelity result.
6. **UNIFORM LIGHTING** - Apply consistent studio lighting across the entire person — face, body, and garments must share the same light direction, intensity, and color temperature. Eliminate any lighting mismatches between the model and garments.
7. **NATURAL SHADOWS** - Add a soft, natural drop shadow beneath the person's feet/shoes on the ground plane, and subtle contact shadows where garments meet the body. This is essential to avoid a "floating cut-out" appearance.
8. **PHOTOREALISTIC RESULT** - The final output should look like a single high-resolution studio photograph, not a composite. Smooth all mask edges and blend seamlessly.

Setting: {scenario}

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:**
- **Identity Lock:** The face, body shape, and body size must remain exactly as the specific person in the input. NEVER slim down, reshape, or alter the person's body in any way.
- **Garment Sizing:** Adapt the garments to fit the person's real body. The clothes stretch and drape to match the person, not the other way around.
- **Full Body:** The ENTIRE person must be visible from head to toe. Never crop the image above the feet.
- **Shoes Required:** The person MUST be wearing shoes. Never generate bare feet. If shoes are not provided as a garment, add stylistically appropriate footwear.
- **Quality Boost:** Ignore low-quality artifacts in the source. Generate a clean, sharp version of that same person.
- **Edge Correction:** If the input has a "cut-out" look, feather the edges, fill in natural lighting, and add soft shadows to blend the model seamlessly into the scene. Never leave hard mask edges visible.
- **Lighting Uniformity:** Match the light on the face, skin, and garments so the entire image has one coherent light source. No mismatched highlights or shadows.
- Only the clothing changes; the person remains the same.
