The camera movement is perfectly smooth and steady, maintaining a constant distance and speed throughout the entire clip. The product does not move or rotate; only the camera moves.
**[Scene]:** A completely white studio void (Hex: #FFFFFF, RGB: 255, 255, 255). The only visible element is the product, nothing else.
