"""
Image selection for generic product R2V spinning.

Uses Gemini to classify product type and view angles in one call,
then selects the best 4 images for VEO reference image generation.

Layout depends on product type (matching stack_and_canvas_images):
  - Shoes/Cars (3D objects): sides solo (pos 1-2), front+back stacked (pos 3-4)
  - Other (flat objects): front+back solo (pos 1-2), sides stacked (pos 3-4)

Your tasks:

   - "cars": vehicles (cars, motorcycles, bicycles, etc.)
   - "other": everything else (clothing, electronics, bags, furniture, accessories, etc.)

2. **For EACH image**, classify:

   a. **View** — Which side of the product is shown:
      - "right": The right side of the product is the dominant view.
      - "left": The left side of the product is the dominant view.
      - "front": The front of the product faces the camera.
      - "back": The back/rear of the product faces the camera.
      - "other": Top-down, bottom/sole, detail shot, or any view that doesn't clearly show one of the four main sides.

   b. **Quality** — Rate 1-10:
      - 10: Sharp, well-lit, clean background, product fully visible
      - 5: Acceptable but some issues (slight blur, busy background, partial crop)
      - 1: Poor quality, heavily cropped, or unusable
