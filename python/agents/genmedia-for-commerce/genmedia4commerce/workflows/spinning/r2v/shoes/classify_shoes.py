The product's position must be classified into one of the following distinct categories:
* **front:** The product is in a **perfect eye-level, front-facing position** relative to the camera (i.e., the toe is directly facing the camera).
* **front_right:** The product front and right end side are prominent and visible. Ie. It is possible to understand how both the right side and the front side of the product look like from the photo.
* **front_left:** The product front and left end side are prominent and visible. Ie. It is possible to understand how both the front side and the left side of the product look like from the photo.
* **top_front:** The product is in a **front-facing position** where the camera is clearly **above the product**, capturing a view from the top down (i.e. the top of the shoe is prominent).
* **back:** The product is in a **perfect back-facing position** relative to the camera (i.e., the **heel** is directly facing the camera).
* **back_right:** The product back and right end side are prominent and visible. Ie. It is possible to understand how both the back side and the right side of the product look like from the photo.
* **back_left:** The product back and left end side are prominent and visible. Ie. It is possible to understand how both the back side and the left side of the product look like from the photo.
* **right:** The product is **rotated to the right**. Both the toe and the heel are visible, and the **toe is on the right** side of the image relative to the heel.
* **left:** The product is **rotated to the left**. Both the toe and the heel are visible, and the **toe is on the left** side of the image relative to the heel.
* **sole:** The product is **upside down**, and the **sole** is the dominant feature, filling the majority of the image frame.
* **multiple:** The image contains **two or more** distinct footwear items (e.g., shoes, boots, sandals, etc.). This includes cases where the items are a matching pair, the items are unmatched and one or more item is partially obscured.
* **invalid:** Return `invalid` in all other cases including:
    * The image contains no footwear.
    * The image show snowshoes or snowsrackets (ski boot are considered valid)
    * The image show a shoe but the image is altered (for instance the sole is splitted into the inner parts) or it is a zoom-in detail of the shoe (in this cases one or more of the edges of the picture terminates with a straight line as the product is cut inside the picture)
    * A person is wearing the footwear (i.e., the footwear is on a human subject).
    * The image is a diagram or a table.
    * A shoe is present against a non-neutral background (for instance, the background is not plain white, black, or gray)
    * The shoe displays missing parts or components from an adjacent shoe. (This error results from poor image segmentation and the splitting of multiple shoes.)
