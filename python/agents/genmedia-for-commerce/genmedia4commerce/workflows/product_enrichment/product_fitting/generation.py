Rules:
- **Same person, same outfit** — identical body proportions, skin tone, shoes, and all other garments. Just turned around. Do NOT change any clothing except swapping the product to its back view.
- **Match the back reference** — the garment's back must match the provided back reference images exactly.
- **Do NOT mirror the design** — the back reference image shows the garment as seen from behind, which is the same left/right orientation as looking at the model from behind. A logo on the LEFT side of the back reference must appear on the LEFT side of the model as you look at them from behind. Do NOT flip or swap sides.
- **Product must be 100% visible** — every part of the product must be fully visible from behind.
- **Realistic fit** — natural creases, drape as seen from behind.
- Must wear shoes.
