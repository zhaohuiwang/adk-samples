# GenMedia for Commerce Agent Quickstart

The **GenMedia for Commerce Agent** is a production-ready solution for generating high-quality retail media, including Virtual Try-On (VTO) videos and 360° product spins (Reference-to-Video / R2V). It is built using the Agent Development Kit (ADK) and demonstrates how to orchestrate complex media generation workflows with Gemini and Veo.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.11+**
- **Node.js 20+**
- **uv** (for dependency management)
- **Terraform** (for infrastructure setup)
- **Google Cloud SDK (gcloud)**

### Step 1: Get the Code

**Option A: Clone directly from adk-samples**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/adk-samples.git
cd adk-samples/python/agents/genmedia-for-commerce
```

**Option B: Create project from template**

This command uses the [Agent Starter Pack](https://goo.gle/agent-starter-pack) to create a new directory (`genmedia_for_commerce`) with all the necessary code.
```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the starter pack and create your project
pip install --upgrade agent-starter-pack
agent-starter-pack create genmedia4commerce -a adk@genmedia-for-commerce
```

<details>
<summary>Alternative: Using uv</summary>

If you have [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed, you can create your project with a single command:
```bash
uvx agent-starter-pack create genmedia4commerce -a adk@genmedia-for-commerce
```
This handles creating the project without needing to pre-install the package into a virtual environment.
</details>

You'll be prompted to select a deployment option — choose **None**, as deployment is already handled in the code repo.

### Step 2: Configure Environment
Copy the example config and fill in your project-specific values:
```bash
cp config.env.example config.env
```
Then edit `config.env` and set at least:
```env
PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
IMAGE_NAME=gcr.io/your-gcp-project-id/genmedia-for-commerce
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
make install
```
This installs Python dependencies via `uv` and frontend packages.

### Step 4: Authenticate with Google Cloud
```bash
gcloud auth login
gcloud auth application-default login
gcloud config set project your-gcp-project-id
```

### Step 5: Infrastructure Setup
Enable necessary APIs and create initial resources via Terraform:
```bash
make setup-infra
```

## 💻 Running Locally

To start the backend and frontend development servers:
```bash
make dev
```
*(Note: Refer to specific Makefiles in `src/backend` and `src/frontend` if running parts separately.)*

---

## ☁️ Cloud Deployment Options

After completing the initial setup, you have two deployment options:

### Option A: Deploy Agent to Vertex AI Agent Engine + Gemini Enterprise
This deployment focuses solely on the agent logic and tools, making it accessible via Gemini Enterprise.

1. **Deploy Agent**:
   ```bash
   make deploy-agent-engine
   ```
2. **Register with Gemini Enterprise**:
   ```bash
   make register-gemini-enterprise
   ```
   Follow the interactive prompts to confirm the Agent Engine ID and link it to your instance.

### Option B: Deploy Full Application (Cloud Run with MCP & Frontend)
This deploys the entire application stack, including the React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MCP server.

1. **Build and Deploy**:
   ```bash
   make deploy-cloudrun
   ```
   This command builds the frontend, packages the application into a Docker container, pushes it to Artifact Registry, and deploys it to Cloud Run.

## Agent Details

| Attribute | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Interaction Type** | Workflow / API |
| **Complexity** | Advanced |
| **Agent Type** | Orchestrator |
| **Components** | Veo 3.1, Gemini 2.5, Image Processing, Validation Loops |
| **Vertical** | Retail / Commerce |

### 1. Clothes Video VTO Pipeline
This pipeline generates a catwalk animation of a model wearing specific clothes.
- **Input**: A full-body image of a model wearing the clothes.
- **Process**:
  1. **Framing**: Splits the image into three framings: lower body, upper body, and face.
  2. **Canvas Creation**: Fits each framing onto a 16:9 canvas.
  3. **Veo Generation**: Calls Veo 3.1 R2V in parallel with the reference images and a detailed animation prompt.
- **Output**: A set of generated videos showing the model walking forward.

### 2. Shoe Spinning (R2V) Pipeline
This pipeline generates a 360° spinning video of a shoe from a few static images.
- **Input**: Multiple images of a shoe from different angles.
- **Process**:
  1. **Classification**: Identifies the viewing angle of each image (front, back, left, right, etc.).
  2. **Selection**: Picks the best images covering the necessary angles.
  3. **Stacking**: Combines images into up to 3 reference images (as limited by the Veo API).
  4. **Generation**: Generates an 8-second video using Veo 3.1.
  5. **Validation**: Checks for correct rotation direction and detects visual glitches. If validation fails, it retries generation up to a configured limit.
- **Output**: A smooth, continuous spinning video of the product.

### 3. Image VTO Pipeline (Static)
This pipeline generates static images of a model wearing specific clothes or glasses.
- **Input**:
  - Person image (Full body for clothes, front face for glasses).
  - Product images (Garments or glasses).
- **Process**:
  1. **Routing**: Routes to clothes or glasses pipeline based on input flags.
  2. **Generation**: Generates multiple variations using Gemini.
  3. **Evaluation**: Ranks variations and selects the best result.
- **Output**: Static images with the best score based on automated evaluation.

### 4. Catalog Search
This capability allows searching the product catalog using natural language queries.
- **Input**:
  - Search query (e.g., "red casual dress").
  - Optional audience filter (e.g., "women", "men").
- **Process**:
  1. **Vector Search**: Uses vector similarity search to find matching products.
  2. **Filtering**: Applies audience filters if provided.
- **Output**: A list of matched products with descriptions and image.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### Backend
- **FastAPI**: For high-performance API endpoints.
- **Google GenAI SDK**: For interacting with Gemini and Veo models.
- **uv**: For fast Python package management.
- **OpenCV & Pillow**: For image and video processing.

### Frontend
- **React** (with Vite): For building the user interface.
